# Hugo Starter
This repository is meant to provide a pre-configured starting point for a website
built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It includes a devcontainer definition which
gives you a ready-to-use development environment in a GitHub codespace so the only
prerequisite for making a site is a computer with a modern web browser and a GitHub
account.
